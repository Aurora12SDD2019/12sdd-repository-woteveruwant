this is where you will write the pseudocode corresponding to the python code in mods.py

BEGIN LoadArray
  # load data into an array
  Let i = 1
  Read DataValue
  
  # if the use enters 'xxx' it means they have finished entering data
  WHILE DataValue < > “xxx” #the symbol '< >' means not equal to
    Let thisArray[i] = DataValue
    i = i + 1
    Read DataValue
  ENDWHILE
  
  Let NumElements = i
  Display “ There are” NumElements “ items loaded into the array”
END LoadArray
